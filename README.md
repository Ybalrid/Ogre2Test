# Ogre 2.1 Test repository
![Screenshot](/screenshot.jpg)
Repository for testing Ogre 2.1

This Use Visual Studio 2015, and the lattest version of Ogre 2.1 from the official mercurial repository as of 10/25/16

Currently the path for Ogre is hardwriten in the project configuration.

The program needs several .dll from Ogre to work. OgreMain, RenderSystem_GL3+ and the non-mobile HLMS.

I'm just messing around with Ogre in this repository. I'm exploring the changes made between 1.9 and 2.1.

I plan in the (near) future to port Annwvyn, my VR game engine to Ogre 2.1 (repository https://github.com/Ybalrid/Annwvyn)
